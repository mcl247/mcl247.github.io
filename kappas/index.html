            <p>Warm greetings from the Iota Chapter of Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. at Cornell University! By landing on this page, youâ€™ve begun your journey with the sisters of Kappa Phi Lambda to discover what we are all about. Our Asian-interest organization was founded in 1995 on the pillars of sisterhood, service and cultural diversity. Our organization is comprised of a diverse group of young women who share similar experiences through our college years and beyond. It is a network of intelligent young women aspiring in various fields and is a resource center filled with endless opportunities upon graduation. To us, sisters of the Iota Chapter, Kappa Phi Lambda is the invisible bond supporting individuals through life challenges and self-discovery. It is a house built on friendship, respect, and a shared vision.</p>
     
            <p>What I personally love about Kappas is our diversity. Not just diversity in ethnicity, but all the different cultural backgrounds, world perspectives, career ambitions, or even how each of us like to have fun. This is brought forth by sisters who are empowered to voice their opinions and tell their own stories. I myself have had enjoyed this open environment to broaden my view of the world. I believe all of this has helped myself, a reserved international student, to thrive and develop into a confident young woman with no inhibition.</p>
        </div><!-- end of left div -->

        <div id="right">
            <p>I encourage you to learn more about our wonderful organization and the values that we stand for. Navigate through our website, browse our image gallery, leave us a message. I hope I have sparked in you a flame of curiosity that may grow into a love that myself and all my sister share for Kappas.</p>
